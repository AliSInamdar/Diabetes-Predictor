# Diabetes-Predictor

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on several medical and demographic features. The model is built using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is a powerful ensemble learning technique used for classification tasks.

The dataset used contains various health-related attributes that can be used to predict whether an individual has diabetes. This project focuses on feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and improving prediction accuracy.

## Project Overview
Diabetes is a serious medical condition, and early detection is crucial for effective management. In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on features such as:

- Age

- Gender

- BMI (Body Mass Index)

- Blood Pressure

- Glucose Levels

- Insulin Levels

We used a Random Forest classifier to build the predictive model and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)

- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

- Random Forest Classifier

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of all instances.

- Precision: The proportion of positive instances correctly identified by the model.

- Recall: The proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified.

- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

After training the Random Forest model, the evaluation shows that the model performs well in predicting diabetes with high accuracy and F1-score.
